-- FFVII REMAKE NEW ABILITIES MOD --

What is?

This MOD adds various abilities:
- "Regroup" to Aerith's Arcane Ward, ATB Ward and Lustrous Shield.
- "ATB Transfer"
- "Limit Transfer"

"Regroup" (Arcane Ward)

Teleport all the players to Aerith's position.

Use "Arcane Ward" with Aerith.
To successfully use "Regroup" Aerith MUST have 2 full ATB bars when using "Arcane Ward", and both bars will be consumed.
If this condition is not met, "Arcane Ward" will work normally but "Regroup" will not be activated.

"Regroup" (ATB Ward)

Teleport all the players to Aerith's position.

Use "ATB Ward" with Aerith.

"Regroup" (Lustrous Shield)

Teleport all the players to Aerith's position.

Use "Lustrous Shield" with Aerith.
To successfully use "Regroup" Aerith MUST have 2 full ATB bars when using "Lustrous Shield", and both bars will be consumed.
If this condition is not met, "Lustrous Shield" will work normally but "Regroup" will not be activated.

Known Issue: If Aerith is the leader sometimes "Regroup" is not triggered, I'm currently digging on the problem, but to be sure the ability will be triggered, simply issue the comand to Aerith while controlling another character.

"ATB Transfer" 

Transfer 1 ATB charge from one character to another.

Use a potion with the character you want to be the "sender" of the ATB charge targeting the character you want to be the receiver of the ATB charge.
The mod keeps your characters HPs to MAXHP - 1 so that you can always use healing items on them.

"Limit Transfer" 

Transfer all the limit charge from one character to another.

Use a high-potion with the character you want to be the "sender" of the limit charge targeting the character you want to be the receiver of the limit charge.
The mod keeps your characters HPs to MAXHP - 1 so that you can always use healing items on them.
